# FlashMLA 2.0.0 for PPU

## Introduction

FlashMLA 2.0.0 is an efficient MLA kernel designed specifically for PPUs, powering the DeepSeek-V4 models.

This repository contains the following implementations:

**Sparse Attention Kernels**

*These kernels power DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), as introduced in [this paper](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp)*

- Token-level sparse attention for the prefill stage, with BF16 KV cache
- Token-level sparse attention for the decoding stage,with BF16 / FP8 KV cache

**Dense Attention Kernels**

- Dense attention for the decoding stage with BF16 KV cache


#### Test & benchmark MLA decoding (Sparse & Dense):

```bash
# Dense:
python tests/test_flash_mla.py
# Sparse:
python tests/test_flash_mla_decoding.py
python tests/test_flash_mla_prefill.py
# Compare test:
python bench_flash_mla.py --baseline torch --target flash_mla --compare
```

## Requirements

- PPU SDK
- ZW 610 / 610E / 810 / 810E / M890
- PyTorch 2.0 or later (a Docker image matching the PPU SDK version is recommended).

## Installation

```bash
python setup.py install
```

## Usage

### MLA Decoding

To use the MLA decoding kernels, call get_mla_metadata once before the decoding loop to get the tile scheduler metadata. Then, call flash_mla_with_kvcache in each decoding step. For example:

```python
from flash_mla import get_mla_metadata, flash_mla_with_kvcache

tile_scheduler_metadata, num_splits = get_mla_metadata(
    cache_seqlens,
    s_q * h_q // h_kv,
    h_kv,
    h_q,
    is_fp8,
    topk,
)

for i in range(num_layers):
    ...
    o_i, lse_i = flash_mla_with_kvcache(
        q_i, kvcache_i, block_table, cache_seqlens, dv,
        tile_scheduler_metadata, num_splits,
        is_causal, is_fp8_kvcache, indices,
    )
    ...
```

Where

- `s_q` is the number of q tokens per q sequence. If MTP (speculative decoding) is disabled, it should be 1.
- `h_kv` is the number of key-value heads.
- `h_q` is the number of query heads.

See `tests/test_flash_mla.py` for a complete example.

**FP8 KV Cache:**
If `is_fp8_kvcache` is set to `True`, the kernel reads the KV cache in the "FP8 with scale" format (described below). It dequantizes the cache to bfloat16 and performs attention computation in bfloat16. The output is also in bfloat16.


**Sparse Attention (`indices` tensor):**
The `indices` tensor (if provided) enables token-level sparse attention by instructing the kernel to compute attention only for specified tokens.

-   **Shape:** `indices` should be a 3D tensor of shape `(batch_size, seq_len_q, topk)`.
-   **Format:** `indices_in_kvcache[i][j][k] = (the index of the page block where token t resides) * page_block_size + (the offset of token t within the page block)`, where `t` is the k-th token for the j-th query sequence in the i-th batch. Since the index of the page block has already been encoded into `indices_in_kvcache`, the kernel does not require the `block_table` parameter.
-   **Invalid entries:** Set invalid indices to `-1`.

**Return Values:**
The kernel returns `(out, lse)`, where:
-   `out` is the attention result.
-   `lse` is the log-sum-exp value of the attention scores for each query head.

See `tests/test_flash_mla_decoding.py` for a complete example.

### Sparse MLA Prefill

For the sparse MLA prefill kernel, call `flash_mla_sparse_fwd` directly with the following parameters:
-   `q`: Query tensor of shape `[s_q, h_q, d_qk]`
-   `kv`: Key-Value tensor of shape `[s_kv, h_kv, d_qk]`
-   `indices`: Indices tensor of shape `[s_q, h_kv, topk]`
-   `sm_scale`: A scalar value

**Note on batching:** This kernel does not support a batch dimension. For multi-batch inference, reshape the input tensors and adjust the `indices` parameter to simulate batch processing.

**Invalid indices:** Set invalid entries in `indices` to `-1` or any number `>= s_kv`.

**Return Values and Equivalent PyTorch Code:**
The kernel returns `(out, max_logits, lse)`. This is equivalent to the following PyTorch operations:

```python
Q: [s_q, h_q, d_qk], bfloat16
kv: [s_kv, h_kv, d_qk], bfloat16
indices: [s_q, h_kv, topk], int32

kv = kv.squeeze(1)  # [s_kv, d_qk], h_kv must be 1
indices = indices.squeeze(1)    # [s_q, topk]
focused_kv = kv[indices]    # For the i-th sequence (s_q), the corresponding KV tokens are selected from the KV cache based on indices[i, :]. This operation results in a tensor of shape [s_q, topk, d_qk].

P = (Q @ focused_kv.transpose(-1, -2)) * sm_scale * math.log2(math.e)    # [s_q, h_q, topk]
max_logits = P.max(dim=-1) # [s_q, h_q]
lse = log2sumexp2(P, dim=-1, base=2)   # [s_q, h_q], "log2sumexp2" means that the exponentiation and logarithm are base-2
S = exp2(P - lse)      # [s_q, h_q, topk]
out = S @ focused_kv  # [s_q, h_q, d_qk]

return (out, max_logits, lse)
```

See `tests/test_flash_mla_prefill.py` for a complete example.
